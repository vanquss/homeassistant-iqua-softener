# iQua app supported water softeners integration for Home Assistant

`iqua_softener` is a _custom component_ for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). The integration allows you to pull data for you iQua app supported water softener from Ecowater company server.

It will create ten sensors with both periodic updates and real-time WebSocket data (default polling interval: 1 minute, with real-time flow updates):
- State - whether the softener is connected to Ecowater server
- Date/time - date and time set on water softener
- Last regeneration - the day of last regeneration
- Out of salt estimated day - the day on which the end of salt is predicted
- Salt level - salt level load in percentage
- Today water usage - water used today
- Water current flow - current flow of water
- Water usage daily average - computed average by softener of daily usage
- Available water - water available to use before next regeneration
- Water shutoff valve state - current state of the water shutoff valve (Open/Closed)

It will also create one switch:
- Water shutoff valve - allows you to remotely open/close the water shutoff valve

The units displayed are set in the application settings.

## Real-Time Data Updates

The integration now supports real-time data updates via WebSocket connection for select sensors:

- **Water Current Flow**: Updates in real-time as water flow changes
- **Other sensors**: Continue to use the configured polling interval for updates

This provides the best of both worlds:
- **Real-time responsiveness** for critical flow monitoring
- **Efficient polling** for less time-sensitive data like salt levels and regeneration status

The WebSocket connection is automatically managed by Home Assistant and will reconnect if the connection is lost.

## Water Shutoff Valve Control

The integration now includes remote control of the water shutoff valve through both a sensor (showing current state) and a switch (for control). This allows you to:

- Monitor the current state of your water shutoff valve
- Remotely shut off water supply in case of emergency
- Integrate valve control into Home Assistant automations

**Important Safety Note:** The water shutoff valve control is intended for emergency use and maintenance purposes. Always ensure you understand the implications of shutting off your water supply before using this feature.

### Example Automations

Here are some example automations you can create:

**Emergency Water Shutoff:**
```yaml
alias: "Emergency Water Shutoff"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.water_leak_detector
    to: "on"
action:
  - service: switch.turn_off
    target:
      entity_id: switch.iqua_softener_water_shutoff_valve
  - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
    data:
      message: "Water leak detected! Water supply has been shut off."
```

**Water Usage Alert with Auto Shutoff:**
```yaml
alias: "High Water Usage Alert"
trigger:
  - platform: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.iqua_softener_water_current_flow
    above: 50  # Adjust threshold as needed
    for:
      minutes: 30
action:
  - service: switch.turn_off
    target:
      entity_id: switch.iqua_softener_water_shutoff_valve
  - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
    data:
      message: "Unusually high water flow detected for 30 minutes. Water supply has been shut off as a precaution."
```

## Installation
Copy the `custom_components/iqua_softener` folder into the config folder.

## Configuration
To add an iQua water softener to Home assistant, go to Settings and click "+ ADD INTEGRATION" button. From list select "iQua Softener" and click it, in displayed window you must enter:
- Username - username for iQua application
- Password - password for iQua application
- Serial number - device serial number, you can find it in iQua app device information tab and field called "DSN#" (this field is case sensitive!)
- Update Interval (minutes) - how often to poll the iQua servers for updated data (default: 1 minute, range: 1-60 minutes)
- Enable Real-time Updates - enable WebSocket connection for real-time data updates (default: enabled)
