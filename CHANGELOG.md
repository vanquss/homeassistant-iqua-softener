# Changelog

All notable changes to the iQua Softener Home Assistant integration will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.3] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Configuration Flow Validation**: Added real-time credential validation during setup
  - Credentials and device access are now validated before completing the integration setup
  - Users cannot complete setup with invalid credentials or unreachable devices
  - Added progress indicators during validation with user-friendly error messages
  - Added reconfigure flow support for updating credentials

### Fixed
- **Authentication Error Handling**: Improved startup error handling to prevent platform setup failures
  - Added proper `ConfigEntryNotReady` exception handling for authentication failures
  - Authentication is now validated before setting up sensor and switch platforms
  - Prevents Home Assistant platform errors when credentials are invalid or API is unavailable
- **Date/Time Display**: Cleaned up date/time sensor format to remove microseconds
  - Date/time sensor now displays clean format: "2025-11-09 15:30:05-07:00" instead of "2025-11-09 15:30:05.785765-07:00"

### Enhanced
- **User Experience**: Enhanced configuration flow with real-time validation and clear error messages
- **Integration Startup**: Improved startup sequence with proper authentication validation and error reporting

## [2.0.2] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Conditional Water Shutoff Valve Entities**: Switch and valve state sensor now only appear if the device actually has a water shutoff valve installed
  - Added `has_water_shutoff_valve()` method to library for proper device capability detection
  - Added `get_device_details()` public method for external access to device information
  - Enhanced device detection logic to check `is_installed` field in water shutoff valve data

### Fixed
- **Missing Switch Issue**: Fixed water shutoff valve switch not appearing due to product serial number handling
  - Resolved product serial number support in switch platform setup
  - Fixed device serial number extraction to properly handle both device_sn and product_sn configurations
- **Improved Water Shutoff Valve Detection**: Enhanced API parsing to properly detect valve availability
  - Updated valve state parsing to respect `is_installed` field from device API response
  - Added comprehensive valve availability checking across multiple API data locations (enriched_data, properties, root level)
  - Switch and valve state sensor creation now conditional based on actual device capabilities

### Enhanced
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved logging and error handling for water shutoff valve operations
- **Device Capability Detection**: More robust detection of device features before creating entities
- **API Response Parsing**: Enhanced parsing of device details to handle various API response formats

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Product Serial Number Support**: Added alternative configuration option to use Product Serial Number instead of Device Serial Number
- **Timezone-Aware Timestamps**: All timestamp sensors now properly convert device UTC time to Home Assistant's local timezone
  - Last regeneration dates now display in local time
  - Out of salt estimated dates now display in local time
  - Available water sensor reset times now use local timezone

### Changed
- Configuration flow now accepts either Device Serial Number OR Product Serial Number (not both required)
- Enhanced validation in configuration flow with clearer error messages
- Improved timezone handling for better compatibility across different Home Assistant installations

### Fixed
- Resolved timezone conversion issues that could cause incorrect date displays
- Fixed configuration validation to properly handle missing serial numbers
